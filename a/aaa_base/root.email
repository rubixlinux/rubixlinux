Subject: Register with the Linux counter project

   (Adapted from a question in the Linux-FAQ)

   9.8. How Many People Use Linux?

   Linux is freely available, and no one is required to register with
   any central authority, so it is difficult to know. Several businesses
   survive solely on selling and supporting Linux. Linux news groups are
   some of the most heavily read on Usenet. Accurate numbers are hard to
   come by, but the number is almost certainly in the millions.

   However, one brave soul, Harald T. Alvestrand <Harald@Alvestrand.no>,
   has decided to try, and asks that if you use Linux, you visit this Web
   site to register:

   http://counter.li.org

   If you don't want to use the Web, send E-mail to
   counter@counter.li.org with the subject line, ``I use Linux at home,''
   or ``I use Linux at work.''

   The current count is posted monthly to comp.os.linux.misc, and is
   always available from the Web site.

Subject: Welcome to Linux (Rubix 1.0)!



Welcome! Glad to see you've made it this far! :^)

Here are a few hints to help you navigate through the Linux operating
system a little bit better:

    Remember the screen you saw while each package was installing? You
can see all the information (and more) again. The simplest way is to use
the 'pacman' utility to view the package contents. You can simply type 'pacman 
-Qi _pkgname_' to get a brief overview of each package. To see the file 
contents of each package just type 'pacman -Ql _pkgname_'.

    You may need to make some changes to the /etc/rc.d/serial script if
you're using serial ports other than /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyS1 (com1: and
com2: under DOS), or if these ports use non-standard IRQs.

    I suggest using the section about halfway through that lets you set up
the ports manually. Here's an example of how I set up the ports on my
machine for /dev/ttyS0 and /dev/ttyS2:

# These are the standard COM1 through COM4 devices
#
${SETSERIAL} /dev/ttyS0 uart 16450 port 0x3F8 irq 4
# ${SETSERIAL} /dev/ttyS1 uart 16450 port 0x2F8 irq 3
${SETSERIAL} /dev/ttyS2 uart 16450 port 0x3E8 irq 5
# ${SETSERIAL} /dev/ttyS3 uart 16450 port 0x2E8 irq 3

You'll also need to add the serial option to the DAEMON line in /etc/rc.conf.

    If you've got hardware such as a CD-ROM drive or ethernet card that
doesn't seem to work with Linux, it's possible that the kernel you're using
doesn't contain the needed support.  In that case, you can do one of
two things:

   1.  Recompile your kernel, including the needed driver(s).
   2.  Load the support with kernel modules.  This is probably the
       simplest way to handle the situation.  Just edit the MODULES line in
       /etc/rc.conf so that it loads the modules you need.

    If you're on a standalone LAN without a nameserver, make sure you
don't have a nameserver line in /etc/resolv.conf, or you may experience
delays with many network commands as they attempt to query the bogus
nameserver.

    Want to run NFS? You'll need to install the portmap and nfs-utils
packages.  Then, edit your /etc/exports to allow NFS access. (see 'man
exports' for examples)  Once you've set up /etc/exports, and add portmap and 
nfsd (in that order) to the DAEMONS line in /etc/rc.conf the NFS daemons should 
run automatically at boot.

    Do you have an IDE based CD-RW drive?  If so, you'll need to use
the SCSI emulation kernel module, which will allow your drive to look
like a SCSI CD burner to cdrdao, cdrecord, and other Linux CD
burning applications.  (Unless you use a 2.6 kernel, which no longer
requires the ide-scsi driver and can use IDE devices like /dev/hdc
directly)
   To load the ide-scsi module simply "unbang" the !ide-scsi option on the 
MODULES line of /etc/rc.conf. You'll also need to pass an option to the kernel 
telling it to use SCSI emulation for a specific device, otherwise the ATAPI 
driver will be used.  Let's say your CD-RW drive is /dev/hdc, then you'd want 
to pass the "hdc=ide-scsi" option to the kernel.  You can do this by editing 
the file /boot/grub/menu.lst, here is an example line:
    kernel /vmlinuz-2.4 root=/dev/sda3 ro vga=791 hdc=ide-scsi
You can also pass the hdc=ide-scsi option on a bootdisk command line.
Once you do this, your CD-RW device will appear as a SCSI device
(/dev/scd0) rather than an IDE device (/dev/hdc).  If this is the only
CD-ROM type device in the machine (there's no DVD drive, for instance),
then you'll probably also want to change your /dev/cdrom symbolic link
to point to the new SCSI device instead of the old IDE device:

   cd /dev
   rm cdrom
   ln -sf scd0 cdrom

    A lot of people ask me how to set up their printer under Linux.  In my
opinion, the best method is to use cups, a system that allows you to print 
many file formats (DVI, PS, PDF, text) by just sending them to the print 
spooler with lpr.  To set this up, do the following steps:

   1.  Make sure you're loading the parallel driver in /etc/rc.conf.
       If you just added it, you can start cups by typing:
       /etc/rc.d/cups start
   2.  Install the cups printer software.  This is the "cups" package on
       the A series.  To install it simply type: pacman -Sy cups
   3.  You'll probably want to have the TCP/IP subsystem installed and
       configured (at least for loopback).  The "tcpip" package is part of
       the N series, and the /etc/rc.conf file is used to do a basic TCP/IP
       configuration.
   4.  cups uses a variety of other filters that it expects to find
       installed.  You'll want to install the "espgs" (Ghostscript)
       package on the AP series to add Ghostscript if you want the ability
       to print PostScript documents.  If you want to print DVI files,
       install at least the default teTeX packages from the T series.
       espgs is installed automatically as a dependency of cups.
   5.  Here are somr more printing related packages you may want to
       install:
         hpijs:      If you use hp inkjet or laserjet printers, you will
                     probably want to install the hpijs package for support
                     for more printers.
         gimp-print: This package contains more printer drivers in case
                     yours is not supported by the default cups
                     installation.
         a2ps:       This package was required by apsfilter, but not cups,
                     it is still usefull though.
         enscript:   If you need more printing options than lpr has,
                     enscript can prettify the output.
         foomatic:   foomatic-db, foomatic-db-engine and foomatic-filters
                     are additional packages that will enable MANY MANY
                     more printers to function with cups.
   6.  The easiest way to configure cups is to use the web configuration.
       Using any browser (firefox, konqueror, links or lynx to name a few),
       on the computer you are trying to configure, simply go to
       http://127.0.0.1:631 and follow the GUI setup, simple!

    If you have a busmouse, you'll need to load a mouse driver module
before your mouse will work.  These days, most mice are PS/2 (with a
6 pin round plug), USB, or serial (with a 9 pin trapazoidal plug).
These kinds of mice don't require any special setup as the system
should detect and activate them automatically. If you think your
mouse might need a special driver (if it's not working), edit the
MODULES line in /etc/rc.conf and add the module you are missing and
it will be loaded at boot time.  It's also possible that the
/dev/mouse link may need to be changed to point to the proper mouse
device. Or, compile a new kernel with built in support for your mouse
and install that.

    To get your machine on the net with a modem and PPP, you need to install
the "tcpip" and "ppp" packages.  Your machine should be configured at
least with loopback using the "netconfig" utility.  Also, be sure the
serial port your modem uses is correctly configured.  If in doubt,
take a look through /etc/rc.d/serial.  Then, use "pppsetup" to
configure the dialup process.  Additional documentation on pppsetup
can be found in /usr/doc/pppsetup-*/.  DSL/Cable users who need to use
PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) should see the docs in /usr/doc/rp-pppoe-3.6/.

    If you installed the F series, there will be lots of FAQs (lists of
Frequently Asked Questions with answers) /usr/doc/Linux-FAQs/, and
HOWTOs (files explaining how to do a particular Linux task), in
/usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs/.  These should be helpful in getting you going
with Linux.  They cover most system admin tasks in a lot more detail
than this little email does.  Also see the RELEASE_NOTES included with
the distribution for any last-minute changes.


Have fun!
