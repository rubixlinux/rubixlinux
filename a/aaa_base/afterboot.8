.Sh NAME
.Nm afterboot
.Nd things to check after the first complete boot
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Starting out
This document attempts to list items for the system administrator
to check and set up after the installation and first complete boot of the
system.
The idea is to create a list of items that can be checked off so that you have
a warm fuzzy feeling that something obvious has not been missed.
A basic knowledge of
.Ux
is assumed, otherwise type
.Pp
.Dl # help
.Pp
Complete instructions for correcting and fixing items is not provided.
There are manual pages and other methodologies available for doing that.
For example, to view the man page for the
.Xr ls 1
command, type:
.Pp
.Dl # man 1 ls
.Pp
Administrators will rapidly become more familiar with Rubix Linux
if they get used to using the high quality manual pages.
.Ss Errata
By the time that you have installed your system, it is quite likely that
bugs in the release have been found.
All significant and easily fixed problems will be reported at
.Pa http://www.rubixlinux.org/errata .
The web page will mention if a problem is security related.
It is recommended that you check this page regularly.
.Ss Login
Log in as
.Dq root .
You can do so on the console, or over the network using
.Xr ssh 1 .
If you wish to deny root logins over the network, edit the
.Pa /etc/ssh/sshd_config
file and set
.Cm PermitRootLogin
to
.Dq no
(see
.Xr sshd_config 5 ) .
.Pp
For security reasons, it is bad practice to log in as root during regular use
and maintenance of the system.
Instead, administrators are encouraged to add a
.Dq regular
user then use the
.Xr su 1
and
.Xr sudo 8
commands when root privileges are required.
This process is described in more detail later.
.Ss Root password
Change the password for the root user.
(Note that throughout the documentation, the term
.Dq superuser
is a synonym for the root user.)
Choose a password that has numbers, digits, and special characters (not space)
as well as from the upper and lower case alphabet.
Do not choose any word in any language.
It is common for an intruder to use dictionary attacks.
Type the command
.Ic /usr/bin/passwd
to change it.
.Pp
It is a good idea to always specify the full path name for both the
.Xr passwd 1
and
.Xr su 1
commands as this inhibits the possibility of files placed in your execution
.Ev PATH
for most shells.
Furthermore, the superuser's
.Ev PATH
should never contain the current directory
.Pq Dq \&. .
.Ss System date
Check the system date with the
.Xr date 1
command.
If needed, change the date, and/or change the TIMEZONE variable in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to the correct time zone in the
.Pa /usr/share/zoneinfo
directory.
.Pp
Examples:
.Pp
Set the current date to January 27th, 1999 3:04pm:
.Dl # date 199901271504
.Pp
Set TIMEZONE in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to Canadian Atlantic Standard Time:
.Dl TIMEZONE=Canada/Atlantic
.Ss Check hostname
Use the
.Ic hostname
command to verify that the name of your machine is correct.
See the man page for
.Xr hostname 1
if it needs to be changed.
You will also need to edit the HOSTNAME variable in the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file to have it stick around for the next reboot.
.Ss Verify network interface configuration
The first thing to do is an
.Ic ifconfig
to see if the network interfaces are properly configured.
Correct by editing the
.Ar interface 
line in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
(where
.Ar interface
is the interface name, e.g.,
.Dq eth0 )
and then using
.Xr ifconfig 8
to manually configure it
if you do not wish to reboot.
You may also set the
.Ar interface
line in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to
.Dq dhcp
e.g.,
.Bd -literal -offset indent
eth0="dhcp"
.Ed
.Pp
This configures the interface to be configured by your local
dhcp server. See
.Xr dhcpcd 8
for more information on the dhcp client and also
.Xr dhcpd 8
for more information on setting up a dhcp server.
.Pp
The loopback interface will look something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
          RX packets:220 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:220 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:17556 (17.1 Kb)  TX bytes:17556 (17.1 Kb)
.Ed
.Pp
and an Ethernet interface something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:A0:CC:3E:35:3D
          inet addr:10.10.10.50  Bcast:10.10.10.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::2a0:ccff:fe3e:353d/64 Scope:Link
          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
          RX packets:9783803 errors:1 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:2328981 errors:2 dropped:0 overruns:2 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000
          RX bytes:623983857 (595.0 Mb)  TX bytes:1007935278 (961.2 Mb)
          Interrupt:22
.Ed
.Pp
.Ss Check routing tables
Issue a
.Ic netstat -rn
command.
The output will look something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
10.10.10.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U         0 0          0 lo
0.0.0.0         10.10.10.1      0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0
.Ed
.Pp
The default gateway address is stored in the
.Dq gw
variable in the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file.
If you need to edit this file, a painless way to reconfigure the network
is
.Ic /etc/rc.d/network stop
before editing
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
followed by
.Ic /etc/rc.d/network start
after editing
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.
Or, you may prefer to manually configure using a series of
.Ic route add
and
.Ic route delete
commands (see
.Xr route 8 ) .
.Pp
If you wish to route packets between interfaces, edit the
.Pa /etc/rc.d/iptables
file and verify that the
.Dq IPTABLES_FORWARD
variable is set to
.Dq 1
and also verify that
.Dq iptables
will be started automatically by checking the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file and making sure that the
.Dq DAEMONS
array contains
.Dq iptables
without a
.Dq \&!
\&.
.Ss Check disk mounts
Check that the disks are mounted correctly by
comparing the
.Pa /etc/fstab
file against the output of the
.Xr mount 8
and
.Xr df 1
commands.
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cat /etc/fstab
/dev/sda3 / reiserfs,acl,rw 1 1
proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
usbfs /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults 0 0
devpts /dev/pts devpts gid=5,mode=620 0 0
/dev/sda2 swap swap defaults 0 0
/dev/sda1 /boot ext3 acl,rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 1 2
/dev/sda5 /tmp reiserfs acl,rw,nosuid 1 2
/dev/sda6 /var reiserfs acl,rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 1 2

# mount
/dev/sda3 on / type reiserfs (rw,acl)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
/dev/sda1 on /boot type ext3 (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,acl)
/dev/sda5 on /tmp type reiserfs (rw,nosuid,acl)
/dev/sda6 on /var type reiserfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,acl

# df

/dev/sda2                               partition       987988  2560    -1
.Ed
.Pp
Edit
.Pa /etc/fstab
and use the
.Xr mount 8
and
.Xr umount 8
commands as appropriate.
Refer to the above example and
.Xr fstab 5
for information on the format of this file.
.Pp
You may wish to do NFS partitions now too, or you can do them later.
.Ss Check the running system
You can use
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr netstat 8 ,
and
.Xr lsof 8
to check on running processes, network connections, and opened files,
respectively.
.Sh CHANGING /etc FILES
The system should be usable now, but you may wish to do more customizing,
such as adding users, etc.
Many of the following sections may be skipped
if you are not using that package (for example, skip the
Kerberos section if you won't be using Kerberos).
If you would like to use a package mentioned in one of the following
sections, you may need to install it by using
.Xr pacman 8 .
While this will be discussed more a bit later, usually a simple
.Ic pacman -Sy xxx ,
where
.Ic xxx
is the package name, will install the required package.
We suggest that you
.Ic cd /etc
and edit most of the files in that directory.
.Pp
Note that the
.Pa /etc/motd
file is overwritten on every boot.
.Ss Add new users
Add users.
There is an
.Xr adduser 8
script.
You may use
.Xr vipw 8
to add users to the
.Pa /etc/passwd
file
and edit
.Pa /etc/group
by hand to add new groups.
You may also wish to edit
.Pa /etc/login.access
and
.Pa /etc/login.defs
to tune some of the limits documented in
.Xr login.access 5
and
.Xr login.defs 5 .
Follow instructions for
.Xr klogin 1
if using
Kerberos
for authentication.
.Ss System command scripts
The
.Pa /etc/rc.*\&
scripts are invoked at boot time by
.Xr init 8 ,
and at shutdown.
The whole process is controlled by
.Xr init 8 .
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/rc.*\&
scripts are in turn influenced by the configuration variables present in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
Any commands to be run at the end of the system boot process
should be made to
.Pa /etc/rc.local .
Commands to be run before system shutdown should be set in
.Pa /etc/rc.shutdown .
.Pp
If you've installed X, you may want to turn on
.Xr xdm 1 ,
the X Display Manager, or kdm the KDE Display Manager.
To do this, set the appropriate value of
.Va DISPLAY_MANAGER
in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Ss Set keyboard type
Use the
.Xr loadkeys 1
command to change the keyboard encoding.
.Ic loadkeys xxx
will select the
.Ic xxx
encoding.
Store the encoding in the
.Dq KEYMAP
variable in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
to make sure it is set automatically at boot time.
.Ss Printers
Edit
.Pa /etc/cups/printers.conf
to get any printers set up.
Consult
.Xr printers.conf 5
if needed.
.Ss Mail aliases
Edit
.Pa /etc/mail/aliases
and set the three standard aliases to go to either a mailing list, or
the system administrator.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Well-known aliases -- these should be filled in!
root:		sysadm
manager:	root
dumper:		root
.Ed
.Pp
Run
.Xr newaliases 1
after changes.
.Ss Sendmail
Rubix Linux
ships with a default
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
file that will work for simple installations; it was generated from
.Pa rubix-localhost.mc
in
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail/cf/cf .
Please see
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail/README.linux
and
.Pa /usr/doc/sendmail-*/op/op.me
for information on generating your own sendmail configuration files.
For the default installation, sendmail is configured to only accept
connections from the local host and to not accept connections on
any external interfaces.
This makes it possible to send mail locally, but not receive mail from remote
servers, which is ideal if you have one central incoming mail machine and
several clients.
Note that sendmail now also listens on port 587 by default.
This is to implement the RFC 2476 message submission protocol.
You may disable this via the
.Ic no_default_msa
option in your sendmail .mc file.
See
.Pa /usr/share/sendmail/README.linux
for more information.
The
.Pa /etc/mail/sendmail.cf
file already has this disabled.
.Ss BIND name server (DNS)
If you are using the BIND name server, check the
.Pa /etc/resolv.conf
file.
It may look something like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
domain nts.umn.edu
nameserver 128.101.101.101
nameserver 134.84.84.84
search nts.umn.edu. umn.edu.
.Ed
.Pp
If using a caching name server, add the line "nameserver 127.0.0.1" first.
To get a local caching name server to run
you will need to add
.Dq bind
to the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
The same holds true if the machine is going to be a
name server for your domain.
.Ss BOOTP server
If this is a BOOTP server, edit
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
as needed.
.Dq dhcp
will have to be added to the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Xr rc.conf .
.Ss Clock synchronisation
In order to make sure the system clock is synchronised
to that of a publicly accessible NTP server,
make sure that the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
contains
.Dq openntpd .
See
.Xr ntpd 8
for more information on setting the system's date.
.Ss DHCP server
If this is a
DHCP
server, edit
.Pa /etc/dhcpd.conf
and the
.Dq DHCPD_OPTS
variable in
.Pa /etc/rc.d/dhcp
as needed.
You will have to make sure that the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
has
.Dq dhcp
enabled.
.Ss NFS server
If this is an NFS server
make sure that the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
has
.Dq portmap
enabled before
.Dq nfsd
which also has to be enabled.
Edit
.Pa /etc/exports
and get it correct.
Next, run
.Ic /etc/rc.d/nfsd restart .
.Ss RPC-based network services
Several services depend on the RPC portmapper,
.Xr portmap 8 ,
being running for proper operation.
This includes YP and NFS exports, among other services.
To get the RPC portmapper to start automatically on boot,
you will need to make sure that the
.Dq DAEMONS
array in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
contains
.Dq portmap .
.Ss YP setup
Check the YP domain name with the
.Xr domainname 1
command.
If necessary, correct it by editing the
.Dq DOMAINNAME
variable in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
You may also set the running system's domain name with the
.Xr domainname 1
command.
To start YP client services, simply run
.Ic /etc/rc.d/yp start .
then perform the remainin
YP activation as described in
.Xr nsswitch.comf 5 .
.Pp
There are many more YP man pages available to help you.
You can find more information by starting with
.Xr ypserv 8 .
.Ss Daily, weekly, monthly scripts
Look at and possibly edit the scripts in
.Pa /etc/cron.hourly, /etc/cron.daily , /etc/cron.weekly ,
and
.Pa /etc/cron.monthly .
.Ss Tighten up security
In
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf
comment out any extra entries you do not need,
and only add things that are really needed.
.Ss Other files in /etc
Look at the other files in
.Pa /etc
and edit them as needed. Do not edit
.Pa localtime ,
nor
.Pa rmt ,
nor any directories.
.Ss Crontab (background running processes)
Check what is running by typing
.Ic crontab -l
as root
and see if anything unexpected is present.
Do you need anything else?
Do you wish to change things?
See
.Xr crontab 1 .
.Ss Packages
Install your own packages.
Rubix Linux only installs a minimal software set during installation.
A large set of fully supported packages is only a command away. See
.Xr pacman 8
for more information on using the
.Xr pacman 8
package manager.
.Pp
Normally, to synchronize your system with the latest security, stability
(and other errata) packages, you would only have to run
.Ic pacman -Syu .
.Pp
Rubix Linux also provides an unsupported
.Dq community
repository. This repository is disabled by default. To enable it,
edit the
.Pa /etc/pacman.conf
file and uncomment the
.Dq [community]
line and the line following it.
