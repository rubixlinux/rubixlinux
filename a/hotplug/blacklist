# Listing a module here prevents the hotplug scripts from loading it.
# Usually that'd be so that some other driver will bind it instead,
# no matter which driver happens to get probed first.  Sometimes user
# mode tools can also control driver binding.
#
# Syntax:  driver name alone (without any spaces) on a line. Other
# lines are ignored.
#

# these drivers cause lots of noise when pcimodules (incorrectly)
# finds them, if you need them, add them to rc.conf

# these drivers are handled by pcmcia_cs (in most cases)

# uhci ... usb-uhci handles the same pci class, so one of the two

# usbcore ... module is loaded implicitly, ignore it otherwise

# tulip ... de4x5, xircom_tulip_cb, dmfe (...) handle same devices

# out) this list.  With these modules blacklisted ALSA will load by default.
