#Todo:
#None

#Notes:
#The patch is to increase security. It is included with loop-aes, the following is
#  in the loop-aes README:
#    When gpg encrypts data with symmetric cipher only or when gpg encrypts
#    secret keyring keys with secret passphrase, gpg uses seeded (salted) and
#    iterated key setup. However, default amount of iteration is tuned for slow
#    processors and can be increased for better resistance against dictionary
#    attacks. Larger key iteration makes key setup much slower, but also makes
#    dictionary attacks much slower too.
#    Included optional gpg patch makes gpg password iteration 128 times slower.
#    gpg stores new iteration value along with seed bytes into symmetric cipher
#    encrypted output file or secret keyring, so unpatched gpg versions will read
#    and decrypt the data just fine.
