pkgdesc="nc (Netcat network utility) Netcat, or "nc" as the actual program is named, is a simple utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.  It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. Netcat was written by *Hobbit* <hobbit@avian.org>, and is a product of Avian Research."
